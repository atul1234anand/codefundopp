**Introduction**

Blockchain has brought in a certain sense of security to technology, giving users an opportunity to execute ledgers while trade ethereum from one user to another. The concept of having ledgers stored in the blockchain and validated, to idea of preventing malicious use of applications, can be extended to create an election and voting application that is completely decentralised.

Unlike a coventional application that has a front end, back end and a database that the backend interacts with, the database and the network are created using the blockchain. the blockchain service, comprises of various nodes attached to one another. Each node will consist of a copy of your ledger. The blockchain is written onto using a smart contract.

**Advantages of using blockchain for the voting application**

- This is very secure because, the proccess of writing on a blockchain is monitored by all the nodes and these nodes participate to ensure that the copy of the transaction across all the nodes remain the same.
- The transactions are monitored by a consensus algorithm, and are cryptographically stored across them.

* *Problems solved*:             
    *  Helping users create account wallets in case they dont have one and assisting them for buying ether for the                                transaction. 
    *  Monitors election result, during the process of voting by ensuring factors like illegitimate voting does not 
                        happen. It also ensure that the elction results are available immediatly post the voting.

* *Technology used*:
    * Solidity
    * Web3.js
    * Azure Workbench
    * Node.js
    * React.js
